I hate all the manga/comic reading apps for Linux, they all suck and the only good one is mangareader. The one I have in windows is very nice and organizes everything pretty well.

I have no idea yet how I want to develop this but maybe I can use what I learn from the manga library app by the time I get here.

this will be the start of a terminal based manga reader using golang.
