I hate all the manga/comic reading apps for Linux, they all suck and the only good one is mangareader. The one i have in windows is very nice and organizes everything pretty well.

i have no idea yet how i want to develop this but maybe i can use what i learn from the manga library app by the time i get here.

this will be the start of a terminal based manga reader using golang.
